  <Step title="Create your database">
    Run the following command in your server console:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE dbname;
    ```

## Accessing Your Database

Use these credentials when configuring your applications:

```yaml
database:
  host: 172.18.0.1  # Enter your node IP if different
  name: dbname      # Your database name
  user: dbusername  # Your database username
  password: password  # Your secure password
  port: 3306        # Default MariaDB port
```
