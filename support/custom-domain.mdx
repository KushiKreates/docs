<Note>
  A custom domain makes your server more professional and easier to remember. Follow this guide to set up yours!
</Note>

## Prerequisites

<Check>
  You need to own a domain name (can be paid or free)
</Check>

<Check>
  Access to your domain's DNS settings
</Check>

<Check>
  Your server's IPv4 address
</Check>

## Step-by-Step Guide  

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set DNS Servers">
    1. Point your domain's DNS servers to [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) or any other DNS provider
    2. Create an account if you don't have one
    3. Add your domain to your DNS provider
    4. Update your domain's nameservers at your registrar
    
    <Warning>
      DNS changes can take 24-48 hours to fully propagate, though they often complete much sooner.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create an A Record for Your Root Domain">
    1. Go to the DNS section for your domain
    2. Create a new "A" record 
    3. For "Name", enter `@` (represents your root domain)
    4. For "IPv4 address", enter your server's IP address (e.g., 83.392.19.107)
    5. Save the record
    
    <Tip>
      This will point example.com directly to your server IP.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Up a Subdomain">
    1. Create another A record with your chosen subdomain (e.g., `play`)
    2. Point it to the same IPv4 address as your root domain
    
    <Tip>
      You can use any subdomain name you prefer such as "mc", "play", "minecraft", or "server".
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a SRV Record">
    Create an SRV record with these values:
    - **Name**: `_minecraft._tcp.play` (replace `play` with your subdomain)
    - **Protocol**: `TCP`
    - **TTL**: `Auto`
    - **Port**: `25565` (replace with your server port)
    - **Target**: `play.example.com` (replace with your subdomain and domain)
    
    <Note>
      The SRV record allows players to connect to your server using just your domain name without specifying a port.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for Propagation">
    Wait a few minutes for your DNS changes to take effect.
    
    <Success>
      Once propagation is complete, players can connect to your server using your custom domain!
    </Success>
