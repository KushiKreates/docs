## After your server has been installed, head over to [Control](https://control.creepercloud.io) and select that server. In your terminal enter the following commands. 

Keep in mind the username and password below can be changed.

```CREATE USER 'username'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';```
```GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;```
```FLUSH PRIVILEGES;```

Changed exmaple 

```CREATE USER 'quickserver'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'realchunp';```
```GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'realchunp'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;```
```FLUSH PRIVILEGES;```

and viola you got yourself a databse server!
