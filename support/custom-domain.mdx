## üìã Requirement

Before you begin, ensure you have a domain. It can be either **paid** or **free**.



## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Configure DNS Servers
Point your domain‚Äôs DNS servers to **Cloudflare** or any other DNS provider.



### Step 2: Add an A Record for Your Domain
1. Use your domain (e.g., `example.com`) ‚Äî replace `example.com` with your actual domain name.
2. Point the domain (`example.com`) to your **server's IPv4 address** (e.g., `83.392.19.107`).



### Step 3: Add an A Record for the Subdomain
1. Create an **A record** for the subdomain, such as `play`, and point it to the **same IPv4 address** as your domain.
2. You can use a different name for the subdomain. For example:
   - If you use `pog` as your subdomain, add an A record for `pog.example.com`.



### Step 4: Create a SRV Record
Configure the **SRV record** with the following details:

- **Name**: `_minecraft._tcp.play`  
  *(Replace `play` with your chosen subdomain.)*  
- **Protocol**: `TCP`
- **SSL**: `Auto`
- **Port**: `25565` *(Replace with your server's port.)*  
- **Target**: `play.example.com`



### Step 5: Wait for Propagation
DNS changes can take a few minutes to propagate. Once complete, your custom domain will be ready to use.
